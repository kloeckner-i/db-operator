# DB Operator

The DB Operator eases the pain of managing PostgreSQL and MySQL instances for applications running in Kubernetes. The Operator creates databases and make them available in the cluster via Custom Resource. It is designed to support the on demand creation of test environments in CI/CD pipelines.

## Features

DB Operator provides following features:

* Create/Delete databases on the database server running outside/inside Kubernetes by creating `Database` custom resource;
* Create Google Cloud SQL instances by creating `DbInstance` custom resource;
* Automatically create backup `CronJob` with defined schedule (limited feature);

## Documentations
* [How it works](docs/howitworks.md) - a general overview and definitions
* [Creating Instances](docs/creatinginstances.md) - make database instances available for the operator
* [Creating Databases](docs/creatingdatabases.md) - creating databases in those instances
* [Enabling regular Backup](docs/enablingbackup.md) - and schedule cronjob
* [Upgrade guide](docs/upgradeguide.md) - breaking changes and guide for the upgrade

## Helm Chart is migrated!
The repository contains helm charts for db-operator is moved to https://github.com/kloeckner-i/charts
New chart after db-operator > 1.2.7, db-instances > 1.3.0 will be only available in new repository.

### Downloading old charts

Installing older version of charts is still possible.
Check available versions by following command.

```
$ helm repo add kloeckneri-old https://kloeckner-i.github.io/db-operator/
$ helm search repo kloeckneri-old/ --versions
```

## Quickstart

### To install DB Operator with helm:

```
$ helm repo add kloeckneri https://kloeckner-i.github.io/charts/
$ helm install --name my-release kloeckneri/db-operator
```

To see more options of helm values, [see chart repo]([https://github.com/kloeckner-i/charts/tree/main/charts/db-operator])
